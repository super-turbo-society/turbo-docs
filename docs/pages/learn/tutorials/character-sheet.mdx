## Walkthrough

:::tip[Development Tip]
The full source code of this game is [available on Github](https://github.com/Stophii/character-sheet) and a video guide on state machines is [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LuQa6T_pKQ&t=2s)

:::

::::steps

### Initialize the Project

Begin by creating a new project called `character-sheet`

```bash [Terminal]
turbo init character-sheet
```

This initializes a Rust project with the following structure:

```
character-sheet/          # Your project's root directory.
├── src/                # The directory of your code. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
```

### Create `state.rs` and `player.rs` files

:::tip[What is a State Machine?]
A State Machine is a programming pattern used to keep your game code organized as you move between different states in the game. In this case, we are going to use it to separate the code for showing different in-game menus: Stats, Loadout and Character. 
:::

Inside your project directory, create a file named `state`. This file will contain your state machine.

```
your-project-dir/       # Your project's root directory.
├── src/                # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game.
|   └── state.rs        # The main file for your state machine. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration.
```

Repeat this process but name it `player` to add in a `player` file. This file will contain your player struct.

```
your-project-dir/       # Your project's root directory.
├── src/                # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game.
|   └── state.rs        # The main file for your state machine.
|   └── player.rs       # The main file for your player. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration.
```

### Enabling another File 

Add the following lines of code to the top of each file.

- [x] lib.rs
```rs [src/lib.rs]
use turbo::*;

use state::*; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
mod state;    // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
use player::*; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
mod player;    // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

```
- [x] state.rs
```rs [src/state.rs]
use crate::*; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]


```
- [x] player.rs
```rs [src/player.rs]
use crate::*; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]


```

This will allow the code we write in `state.rs` and `player.rs` to be recognized inside of `lib.rs` and vice versa. Don't forget to save each file with Cmd+S or Ctrl+S.

### Run the Game

At this point, we can run our game and leave it running as we make changes. Don't worry, it is just a blank screen for now!

```bash [Terminal]
turbo run -w character-sheet
```

:::tip[Development Tip]
If you want it to always appear above your other open windows you can run it with
```bash [Terminal]
turbo run -w -A character-sheet
```

The `-A` will make it "always on top". Since Turbo games update as soon as you save, it's good practice to keep the game running while you are coding!

Additionally, if you run the command from the directory you saved your game in, you can forgo the project name, like this

```bash [Terminal]
turbo run -w -A
```
:::

Now lets go through each individual file and add some code so we can intialize them

### `state.rs`

Add this code to your `state.rs` file. This is an enum we'll use for switching screens:

```rs [src/state.rs]
use crate::*;

#[turbo::serialize] // add this above structs and enums // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
pub enum Screen { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    Character, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    Inventory, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    Loadout, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
```

:::tip[Development Tip]
An enum lets you define a collection of related named values. In this case we use it for the different screens in our game. Using `enums` makes your code much more readable and less error prone.
:::

### `player.rs`

Add this code to your `player.rs` file. These `structs` and `enums` will build out the basis of our character, inventory, and loadout screens.

```rs [src/player.rs]
use crate::*; 

#[turbo::serialize] // add this above structs and enums // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
pub struct Player { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub max_hp: f32, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub current_hp: f32, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub atk: f32, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub inventory: Vec<Item>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub inventory_index: usize, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub inventory_slots: usize, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub loadout: Loadout, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub loadout_index: usize, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub loadout_slots: usize, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

impl Player { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub fn new() -> Self { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        Self { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            max_hp: 100.0, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            current_hp: 100.0, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            atk: 1.0, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            inventory: vec![ // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                Item { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                    name: "HP Potion".to_string(), // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                    description: "HP +50".to_string(), // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                    quantity: 1, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            ], // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            inventory_index: 0, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            inventory_slots: 4, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            loadout: Loadout { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                weapon: Weapon::Sword, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                passive: "ATK Up".to_string(), // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            loadout_index: 0, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            loadout_slots: 2, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]


#[turbo::serialize] // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
pub enum Weapon {  // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    Sword, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    Gun, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

#[turbo::serialize] // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
pub struct Item { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub name: String, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub description: String, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub quantity: u32, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

#[turbo::serialize] // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
pub struct Loadout { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub weapon: Weapon, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    pub passive: String, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
```
By adding an `impl` for the `player` we can intialize it in gamestate with a `new()` function. We also have an `enum` for our `Weapon` and `structs` for the `Item` and `Loadout`. We'll be altering these values and adding more functions to our `impl` later!

We also added in values like the index and slots for our `inventory` and `loadout`

### `lib.rs` & `GameState` Initialization

Now we can head into `lib.rs` and add the following fields to `GameState`

```rs [src/lib.rs]
use turbo::*;

use state::*; 
mod state; 
use player::*; 
mod player; 

#[turbo::game]
struct GameState {
    screen: Screen, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    player: Player, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    frames: u32, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    spawned: bool, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    equip: bool, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
}

impl GameState {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // initialize your game state
        Self { 
            screen: Screen::Character, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            player: Player::new(), // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            frames: 0,  // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            spawned: false, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            equip: false, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        }
    }
    pub fn update(&mut self) {
        // This is where your main game loop code goes
        // The stuff in this block will run ~60x per sec
    }
}
```

### Adding in the State Machine

Now we'll add in an empty state machine into the `state.rs` file. We'll use it to change between screens.

```rs [src/state.rs]
use crate::*; 

#[turbo::serialize] // add this above structs and enums 
pub enum Screen { 
    Character, 
    Inventory, 
    Loadout, 
} 

pub fn state_machine(state: &mut GameState) { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    match state.screen { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        Screen::Character => { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        Screen::Inventory => { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        Screen::Loadout => { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
```
And then we'll call the `state_machine` function from our update loop, so that it is always running.

```rs [src/lib.rs]
pub fn update(&mut self) {
    // This is where your main game loop code goes
    // The stuff in this block will run ~60x per sec
    state_machine(self); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
}
```

Make sure to save your project after adding it in.

:::tip[Development Tip]
Saving your project is done with `Cmd+S` (MacOS) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows).
If you ever need to reset your game, you can do that with `Cmd+R` (MacOS) or `Ctrl+R` (Windows).

It is smart to save after every step!
:::

### Adding in our player sprite

Now that we have built the foundation, we can add some visuals to our game! Lets start by displaying our character in the middle of the screen and start creating their character screen

Inside your project directory, create a folder named `sprites`. This folder will contain all your game sprites.

```
your-project-dir/       # Your project's root directory.
├── sprites/            # The directory of your sprite assets. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── src/                # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game.
|   └── state.rs        # The main file for your state machine.
|   └── player.rs       # The main file for your player.
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration.
```
Add the following files to the `sprites` directory.

- [x] [player.aseprite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stophii/character-sheet/master/sprites/player.aseprite)
- [x] [potion.aseprite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stophii/character-sheet/master/sprites/potion.aseprite)

:::tip[Development Tip]
You can see the player sprite is a `.aseprite` file. [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) is a great tool for pixel art, and Turbo has a deep integration that lets you read the animation tags straight from the files. You can read more about it [here.](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/sprites)
:::

### Character Screen

Lets display our player character and start building a stat screen around him in the `Screen::Character` portion of our `state_machine`

We just need one line of code to draw the sprite. Make sure to save after this, and now you should see the character on screen.

```rs [src/state.rs]
pub fn state_machine(state: &mut GameState) { 
    match state.screen { 
        Screen::Character => { 
            sprite!("player#Idle"); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } 
        Screen::Inventory => { 
        } 
        Screen::Loadout => { 
        } 
    } 
}
```
![Character displayed in one line of code](/character-sheet.png)

Let's fill up this screen with some more info about the character:

```rs [src/state.rs]
pub fn state_machine(state: &mut GameState) { 
    match state.screen { 
        Screen::Character => { 
            state.frames += 1; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            let character = animation::get("character"); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            sprite!( // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                animation_key = "character", // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                default_sprite = "player#Idle", // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            ); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            if !state.spawned { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                character.use_sprite("player#Spawn"); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                character.set_repeat(1); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                state.spawned = true; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            rect!(x = 140, y = 5, w = 100, h = 130, color = 0x000000ff, border_color = 0xffffffff, border_size = 1, border_radius = 2); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            let stats = format!("{}'s stats\n\nHp: {}/{}\nAtk: {}\nCrit: {}%", state.player.name, state.player.max_hp, state.player.current_hp, state.player.atk, state.player.crit); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            text_box!(&stats,x = 142, y = 6, w = 98, h = 129); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]  
            if state.frames >= 360 { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                let choices = ["player#Jump", "player#Crouch", "player#Dash"]; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                let idx = (random::u32() as usize) % choices.len(); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                let anim = choices[idx]; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                character.use_sprite(anim); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                character.set_repeat(1); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                state.frames = 0; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } 
        Screen::Inventory => { 
        } 
        Screen::Loadout => { 
        } 
    } 
}
```
![Character screen displaying stats](/stepcharacter.gif)

Nice, now we have our character screen setup! We added in a way to view their current stats that will vary based on loadout. We also added in some personality, changing their animation every 6 seconds to a randomly chosen animation as well as a spawn in animation that only plays once upon initial load. 

We used several built in Turbo macros in this section: [`rect!`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/rectangles) for the menu, [`text_box!`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/text_box) for the text, and [`sprite!`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/sprites) for the animation. We also made use of [`random::u32`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/randomness/) to randomly select an animation from the provided list.

### Adding State Machine controls

Lets build out the inventory screen next. Our first step needs to be adding functionality to switch screens.

```rs [src/lib.rs]
    pub fn update(&mut self) {
        // This is where your main game loop code goes
        // The stuff in this block will run ~60x per sec
        state_machine(self);
        if gamepad::get(0).a.just_pressed() { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            self.screen = Screen::Inventory; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        if gamepad::get(0).b.just_pressed() { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            self.screen = Screen::Character; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        if gamepad::get(0).x.just_pressed() { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            self.screen = Screen::Loadout; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    }
```

Now if we press `a` we can switch to the `Screen::Inventory` and if we press `b` we can switch back to `Screen::Character`. We added in pressing `x` to switch to `Screen::Loadout`.

:::tip[Development Tip]
Turbo controls support gamepad and keyboard:

| Gamepad | Keyboard (P1)       |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| A       | `Z`                 |
| B       | `X`                 |
| X       | `C`                 |

### Adding `Tweens` and `Const`

If this is your first time seeing or hearing about `tweens`, awesome! `Tweens` allow for smooth transitions of `f32` (decimal) values. They're easy to implement, and great for making your game look polished!

We need one `Tween` instance in the `GameState` for each value we want to be able to manipulate. In total we are going to add 8 tweens and initialize them, as well as a `Const` to the top. `Consts` are just values that won't be changing

```rs [src/lib.rs]
const POS: [(f32, f32); 4] = [(118.0,49.0), (154.0,34.0), (127.0,15.0), (101.0,34.0)]; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

#[turbo::game]
struct GameState {
    screen: Screen,
    player: Player, 
    frames: u32, 
    spawned: bool,
    // x value tweens // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_one_x: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_two_x: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_three_x: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_four_x: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    // y value tweens // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_one_y: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_two_y: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_three_y: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    slot_four_y: Tween<f32>, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
}
 
impl GameState {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // initialize your game state
        Self { 
            screen: Screen::Character, 
            player: Player::new(),
            frames: 0,  
            spawned: false,
            // x value tweens // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            slot_one_x: Tween::new(118.0) // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
                .ease(Easing::EaseOutCubic) // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

The `Tweens` will give our inventory screen a lot of personality. The `Const` represent where our inventory slots will be located on the canvas. Now we can build out that `Screen::Inventory`

:::tip[Development Tip]
[`Tweens`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/tween) need an initial starting value as `f32`, an `easing`, and a duration as `usize` to initialize. Feel free to tweak the `duration` and `easing` to suit your preference!

### Inventory Screen

Inside our state machine in `state.rs` add the following

```rs [src/state.rs]
    Screen::Character => {

        rect!(xy = slot_three, wh = size_three, color = 0xffffff44, border_radius = 4); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        rect!(xy = slot_four, wh = size_four, color = 0xffffff44, border_radius = 4); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        sprite!("potion#HP Charge", xy = if state.player.inventory_index == 0 {(slot_one.0 + 1.0, slot_one.1+ 1.0) } else { slot_one }, scale = if state.player.inventory_index == 0 {1.0} else {0.5}); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        sprite!( // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

            default_sprite = "player#Idle", // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

        let debug = match state.player.inventory.get(state.player.inventory_index) { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            Some(item) => format!("{} x{}\n{}", item.name, item.quantity, item.description), // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            None => "".to_string(), // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

            0 => {text!(&debug, x = 47, y = 15)}, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            _ => {text!("Empty slot...", x = 50, y = 15)}, // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    } 
```

And add the controls to `lib.rs`

```rs [src/lib.rs]
    pub fn update(&mut self) {
        // This is where your main game loop code goes
        // The stuff in this block will run ~60x per sec
        state_machine(self);

        if gamepad::get(0).a.just_pressed() {
            self.screen = Screen::Inventory;
        } 

        if gamepad::get(0).b.just_pressed() {
            self.screen = Screen::Character;
        }

        if gamepad::get(0).x.just_pressed() {
            self.screen = Screen::Loadout;
        }

        if gamepad::get(0).left.just_pressed() { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            self.player.inventory_index = (self.player.inventory_index + self.player.inventory_slots - 1) % self.player.inventory_slots; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

        if gamepad::get(0).right.just_pressed() { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            self.player.inventory_index = (self.player.inventory_index + 1) % self.player.inventory_slots; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
    }
```

![Inventory screen completed with character and tweening](/stepinventory.gif)

We make use of [`camera::set_xyz`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/camera) [`tween`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/tween) and of course [`sprite!`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/sprites) and [`rect!`](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/api/rectangles) again.

The `Tweens` allow for smooth movement of the `x` and `y` values of our squares which are our inventory slots. We also change the size of each square if it is in the front slot. We also change the size of the item.

The controls change the value of `state.inventory_index` and we change the values of our `tweens` based on what that inventory index is. We have wrapping as well so we never hit an "end".

Zooming in with the `camera` allows you to see our character's face and item sprites as the player looks through their inventory. It also makes the item descriptions and names larger and easier to view. Our main character's idle animation has them blink, which is a nice touch while browsing the inventory system.


Next up is the `Screen::Loadout`

### Loadout Screen

Add the following code inside the `Screen::Loadout` of our `state_machine`

```rs [src/state.rs]
    Screen::Loadout => { 
        let character = animation::get("character"); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        let equipcolorsword = if matches!(state.player.loadout.weapon, Weapon::Sword) { 0x00FFFFFF } else { 0xFFFFFFFF }; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        let equipcolorgun = if matches!(state.player.loadout.weapon, Weapon::Gun) { 0x00FFFFFF } else { 0xFFFFFFFF }; // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
        sprite!( // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

        if state.player.loadout_index == 1 { // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
            rect!(x = 215, y = 67, w = 10, h = 10, rotation = 45); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]

We need to spruce up our controls in the `lib.rs` real quick

```rs [src/lib.rs]

![Loadout screen completed with character playing animation specific to weapon selected](/steploadout.gif)

Awesome now we have controls that are specific to each state. We can enter our `Screen::Inventory` with `a` and we can leave with `b`. We can enter our `Screen::Loadout` with `x` and leave that screen with `b`.

On the loadout screen itself we can use the arrow keys to switch between sword and gun and equip it with `a`. After equipping our weapon of choice we get an animation to reflect what we have equipped as well as a blue highlight.

We made use of `bounds` for the sword and gun UI choices. `Bounds` is a useful tool when making your game work on multiple resolutions as well as adding touch/tap controls!

## Conclusion

You have made a working character sheet! you used a lot of tools that will be valuable to master like the `state machine`, `tweening`, and `bounds`. You used the basics like `rect!` `sprite!` and `text_box!`. 

You can use this as the start of an RPG game! If you want to do more, I suggest the following:

:::warning[Quest]
Now with the tutorial completed you can improve it further! Try doing the following:
- [ ] Add your own sprites to change the main character
- [ ] Fill out the rest of the inventory with items instead of empty slots
- [ ] Add another weapon option
- [ ] Tween the size of the sprites in the inventory menu
- [ ] Add indicators for controls
- [ ] Add a title screen!
