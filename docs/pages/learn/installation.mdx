:::info
**Note for Windows Users**

Before continuing, we recommend you install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and open **Git Bash as an administrator** to run the commands described in this documentation.
:::

You can install `turbo` on the command line in 3 easy steps:

::::steps

### Install Rust

:::code-group

```bash [MacOS / Linux]
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

<div data-title="Windows">

Download and run the [Rust Installer](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe).

</div>
:::

:::note

<sup>
  <p>If you already have rust installed, you can skip this step.</p>
</sup>
:::

### Add the WebAssembly Target

```bash [Terminal]
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

:::note

<sup>
  If you already have ready added the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target with
  `rustup`, you can skip this step.
</sup>
:::

### Install Turbo CLI

```bash [Terminal]
curl -sSfL https://turbo.computer/install.sh  | sh
```

::::

You can verify your installation by running `turbo -v`. This should output `turbo 0.9.0`.

:::note
If you wish to install `turbo` by manually downloading pre-built binaries, you can check out the [archive of all releases](https://github.com/super-turbo-society/turbo-cli/releases) on Github. You can also install a specific version `curl -sSfL
  https://turbo.computer/install.sh | TURBO_VERSION=0.0.0 sh`. Just replace `0.0.0` with a valid version.
