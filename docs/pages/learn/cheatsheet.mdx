## Starting a Project

To create a new project, you can run the command `turbo init <PROJECT-NAME>`. For example, we could run the following command if we want to make a project called `hello-world`:

```bash [Terminal]
turbo init hello-world
```

This will create a new project directory with the following structure:

```txt
hello-world/      # Your project's root directory.
├── src/          # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs    # The main file for the game.
├── Cargo.toml    # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml    # Turbo configuration.
```

Once the project has been initialized, you can run it with `turbo run -w <PROJECT-NAME>`. For example, to run the `hello-world` project we created with the previous command:

```bash [Terminal]
turbo run -w hello-world
```

:::note
The `-w` flag enabled watch mode so your game window will automatically reflect changes you make to game code or assets.

## Updating Your Config

When you initialize a project, you'll see a file called `turbo.toml` in your project directory. If you open that file, you should see something like this:

```rust title="turbo.toml"
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name"]
description = "An awesome game made in Turbo!"

[canvas]
width = 256
height = 144
```

## Managing Assets

Assets go in special subdirectories within the project directory. All asset folders are optional, so if you don't have a certain kind of asset, there is no need to add an empty directory.

```
your-project-dir/    # Your project's root directory.
├── sprites/         # The directory of your sprite assets. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── fonts/           # The directory of your font assets. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── audio/           # The directory of your audio assets. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── shaders/         # The directory of your shaders. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── src/             # The directory of your code. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
│   └── lib.rs       # The main file for the game.
├── Cargo.toml       # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml       # Turbo configuration.
```

:::tip
Turbo will automatically update your game if assets are added/removed/modified while running.

## Drawing Shapes

```rs
// Draw a 20x40px blue rectangle
rect!(w = 20, h = 40, x = 70, y = 70, color = 0xff00ffff)

// Draw an 16px diameter magenta circle
circ!(d = 16, x = 120, y = 64, color = 0xff00ffff)

## Displaying Text

```rs
// Basic text
text!("Hello, world!");

// Customized text with specified position, color, and font size
text!(
    "Greetings, earthlings >:3",
    x = 30,
    y = 40,
    color = 0x00ff00ff,
    font = "small"
);

## Handling Mouse & Touch Controls

```rs
// The pointer control works for both mouse and touch inputs
let p = pointer();

// Get the pointer x position
let pointer_x = p.x;

// Get the pointer y position
let pointer_y = p.y;

// Check if the pointer was just pressed this frame (mouse click or touch)
if pointer.just_pressed() {
    // ...
}
```

## Handling Gamepad Controls

```rs
// Get player 1's gamepad (Pass a 1 instead of a 0 for player 2's gamepad)
let gp = gamepad(0);

// Check if the `Up` button was just pressed this frame.
if gp.up.just_pressed() {
    // ...
}

// Check if the `Down` button is currently being pressed.
if gp.down.just_pressed() {
    // ...
}

// Check if the `A` button was just released this frame.
if gp.a.just_released() {
    // ...
}

// Check if the `B` button is currently not being pressed.
if gp.b.released() {
    // ...
}
```

## Generating Random Numbers

```rs
// Get a random number
let n = rand();

// Check if a random number is even
let is_even = rand() % 2 == 0;

// Check if a random number is odd
let is_odd = rand() % 2 != 0;

// Get a random number between 1-100
let n = 1 + (rand() % 100);

// Probability Ranges
match n {
    1..=10 => { ... }  // 10% chance
    11..=50 => { ... } // 40% chance
    _ => { ... }       // 50% chance
}
```

## Tracking Time

In most cases, using the current game "tick" is sufficient for working with time in a game. It starts at `0` and increases by one each time a new frame is rendered.

```rs
let t = tick();
```

When you need an actual unix timestamp, we've also got you covered:

```rs
let timestamp = time::now();
```

## Adjusting the Camera

```rust
// Get the camera position
let (x, y, z) = camera::xyz();

// Set the camera position
// The position you set here is the center of the viewport in pixels. By default the camera starts at half of the width and height of your game's resolution.
camera::set_xy(100, 100);

// Move the camera position relative to the current camera position
camera::move_x(5.0);
camera::move_y(8.0);

// Reset the camera to its original position
camera::reset();
```

## Debugging

Turbo's logging system prints directly to your terminal, making it easy to trace variable values, game state, and behavior during runtime. Whether you're narrowing down a bug or watching a value evolve, `log!` is your go-to for visibility without disruption.

:::code-group

```rs [Your Game Code]
// Log a static message
log!("o hai!");

// Log a single value
let some_var = "foo";
log!("one value: {:?}", some_var);

// Log multiple values
let another_var = 42;
log!("multiple values: {:?} {:?}", some_var, another_var);

// Log game state
log!("My game state = {:?}", self);
```

```txt [Output]
[turbo] o hai!
[turbo] one value: "foo"
[turbo] multiple values: "foo" 42
[turbo] My game state = *your game state will show up here*
```

:::

:::tip[Avoid Noisy Logs]
You probably don't want to log a value every frame of your game loop. It can clutter your console and prevent you from seeing the useful information you may be looking for. Instead, try including logs only when a specific action happens such as a keypress or mouse click.

## Turbo Game Structure

Turbo provides a straightforward way to initialize the standard game state. 

-Create a new struct with GameState values.
-Initialize the state in the new() function.
-Run the game loop from the update() function. Turbo games run at 60 fps. 

Here is an example using the appropriate format. 

```rs
use turbo::*;

// Turbo procedural macro
#[turbo::game]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
struct GameState { 
        x_position: i32,
        y_position: i32,
}

impl GameState{
    fn new()->Self{
        // Return the GameState's initial value. [!code hl]
        // You can also run initialization code here before returning the state.
        Self {
            x_position: 30,
            y_position: 40,
        }
    }
    fn update(&mut self){
    // Update State [!code hl]
    // The bulk of your game's logic goes here. Mutate state as-needed.
    }   
}

```

:::tip[Resetting Game State]
In development, you can reset the state of the game to its initial state anytime by using a simple keyboard shortcut `Cmd+R` on MacOS/Linux and `Ctrl+R` on Windows.
